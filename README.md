Joining the RPGCraft Modded Survival Server:

Download CurseForge. (More Stable that normal Forge.) https://download.curseforge.com/

Create a Forge Profile for Forge 43.2.11.(1.19.2) Then save and run the profile 1 time to allow it to install all client Forge packages.

Download the "mods.zip" folder, extract the folder then Right click your Curseforge profile and select "open folder". If a mod folder is already present, then copy the inside of the extracted "mods.zip" and copy the mods to the CurseForge mod folder. (If no "mods" folder is present, just move the extracted folder into the root of the Curseforge profile folder.)

Google Drive to download copy of server mods. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Oi1Gu2JXMqCvbtzH85gjEGEEMuzEPhLc?usp=sharing

(Disclaimer many mods in this folder have keybinds that conflict with other mods, you will have to change some keybinds around for personal use!)

To join the server, the IP is : guncraft.rdcsmp.live.
